# C++ Exercises

C++ Exercises for students I created to apply real world concepts to. These exercises are really involved and require critical thinking.


## Exercise 1: Popular Names

This exercise should be given after learning PODS classes and structs. Uses real world data of baby names from The United States Social Security Administration (SSA).

## Exercise 2: Pokemon

This exercise should be given after learning ADTs and File I/O extensively. Uses real Pok√®mon Red and Blue game data from Bulbapedia.
